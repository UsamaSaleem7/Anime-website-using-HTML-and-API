My name is Usama Saleem, MISIS No. M00676098, I am a 3rd year Computer Systems Engineering student in Middlesex University Dubai.
This is a solo project that I have done. I have chosen to make a website about anime for this project. This project was really fun to make and I enjoyed trying new things using HTML and CSS.
I really liked using the marquee function to display moving text.
I have used ajax to show this information on the webpage.
